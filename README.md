Data Warehouse Project: Airline Company. (April 2023)
"I worked on a project to develop a data warehouse for an airline company. 
My responsibilities included gathering business requirements, designing and building a data warehouse model using Oracle, 
and populating the model with randomly generated data. 
I used the model to gain insights into the airline company's operations and customer behavior, which helped the management team make data-driven decisions. 
Through this project, I demonstrated my skills in data modeling, SQL, and data analysis."
